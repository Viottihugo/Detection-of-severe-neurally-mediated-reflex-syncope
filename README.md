# ECG signal analysis: Prediction of the spatial coordinates of severe neurally mediated reflex (neurocardiogenic or vasovagal) syncope using ECG Data.
 
Hello! This is a collaborative project that tries to determine the position of severe neurally mediated reflex using the ECG data of patients that are known to have it and then search for an appropriate model and apply it on similar datasets to see if those locations can be predicted.

We are trying to find reliable data to work with. In the meantime we are doing some paper research to see what's the ideal processing that needs to be done with the signal in order to make it less bulky (right now every study consists of several hundreds of txt files).
