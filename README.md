# ECG signal analysis: Prediction of the spatial coordinates of severe neurally mediated reflex (neurocardiogenic or vasovagal) syncope using ECG Data.
 
Hello! This is a collaborative project that tries to determine the position of severe neurally mediated reflex using the ECG data of patients that are known to have it, search for an appropriate model and apply it on similar datasets to see if those locations can be predicted.
